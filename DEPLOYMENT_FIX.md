# 🚨 Azure Deployment Not Auto-Updating

## **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

Your code is correct, but Azure Static Web Apps isn't auto-deploying from GitHub.

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Local `index.html` has NO Tailwind CDN
- ✅ Local `index.html` has NO index.css link  
- ❌ Live site STILL shows these errors
- ❌ Multiple commits pushed, but old build still live

## **ROOT CAUSE:**

Azure Static Web Apps auto-deploy from GitHub may not be configured properly.

---

## **🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX - Manual Deploy Using SWA CLI:**

### **Step 1: Install Azure Static Web Apps CLI**

```bash
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Manually**

```bash
# Your app is already built in ./dist folder
# Deploy using the deployment token
swa deploy ./dist --deployment-token 95e8b24e6d320066ec8f024c1cda626c0152698d98a9a5831a45e18520c53cd403-173604a9-1d4d-4d4c-994a-966d785c420f01021070ebf93610 --env production
```

This will deploy your built app directly to Azure, bypassing GitHub Actions.
