# PAIS Sea Turtle Nesting: Mobile LiDAR Thesis Research Framework

**Master's Thesis Research | TAMU-CC | 2024-2026**

Comprehensive HTML documentation suite for Mobile LiDAR-based conservation research at **Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS)**. This framework supports the transition from laboratory egg incubation to **in-situ (natural) nesting** by identifying safe zones using twice-yearly MLS surveys.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Title:** "Investigating Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Sea Turtle Nesting Management at Padre Island National Seashore"

**Collaboration:**
- Dr. Donna Shaver (PAIS Sea Turtle Biologist)
- Dr. Michael Starek (TAMU-CC Remote Sensing)

**Timeline:** 2024-2026 | Twice-yearly MLS surveys (May-June nesting, August-September hatching)

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **5 ready-to-start thesis ideas** with complete workflows  
✅ **No coding required** - All ArcGIS Pro GUI-based tools  
✅ **Management-focused outputs** - Safe zone identification maps  
✅ **Literature-grounded** - Backed by 2018-2025 research  
✅ **Twice-yearly survey advantage** - May→August seasonal stability  

## 🔬 Analytical Framework

- **Temporal Differencing:** DEM_Aug - DEM_May = Seasonal Erosion Rate
- **Nest-Scale Analysis:** 50m buffer around GPS locations → Zonal Statistics
- **Multi-Year Persistence:** Stack 2024, 2025, 2026 DEMs → Coefficient of Variation
- **Vehicle Comparison:** T-test comparing erosion rates (vehicle vs. no-vehicle zones)
- **Elevation Thresholding:** Kemp's ridley optimal range (1.5-4.0m above MHW)
- **SLR Scenario Testing:** +0.4m, +0.8m, +1.34m applied to current DEMs

## 📊 Expected Deliverables

- **Safe zone identification maps** for in-situ nesting
- **Seasonal erosion risk layers** (May→August)
- **Vehicle impact assessments** (statistical comparison)
- **SLR vulnerability matrices** (2045, 2050, 2060)
- **Multi-year habitat persistence classifications**
