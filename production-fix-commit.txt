fix: Remove Tailwind CDN and fix production build issues

Fixes:
- Removed Tailwind CSS CDN script (not for production)
- Removed broken index.css link (404 error)
- Now using properly installed Tailwind via PostCSS
- Styles handled through main.css via Vite
- Clean production build ready

This resolves console warnings and 404 errors in production.
Firebase domain still needs to be whitelisted for auth to work.
