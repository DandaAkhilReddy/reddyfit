## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Option 1: Use GPT-3.5 Turbo (90% AI cost reduction)

**Savings: $14/month ($168/year)**

| Change | Old Cost | New Cost | Savings |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Switch to GPT-3.5 Turbo | $15.00 | $1.00 | $14.00/month |

**Total Monthly Cost: $101.03**

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly lower quality summaries
- Still very capable for documentation tasks
- Consider GPT-4 only for weekly investor reports

---

### Option 2: Self-Host Temporal (50% workflow cost reduction)

**Savings: $50/month ($600/year)**

**Infrastructure Required:**
- 2x Azure B2s VMs (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM): $30/month
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Basic): $20/month
- **Total Infrastructure Cost: $50/month**

**Net Savings: $100 - $50 = $50/month**

**Trade-offs:**
- Operational complexity (setup, maintenance, updates)
- Requires DevOps expertise
- No managed support
- Need to handle scaling, backups, monitoring

**Recommendation:** Start with Temporal Cloud, migrate to self-hosted if budget constrained.

---

### Option 3: Use Prefect Cloud Instead of Temporal

**Savings: $100/month ($1,200/year)**

**Prefect Cloud Pricing:**
- Free tier: Up to 20,000 task runs/month
- Our usage: ~7,000 actions/month
- **Cost: $0.00/month**

**Total Monthly Cost: $15.03**

**Trade-offs:**
- Different workflow paradigm (less durable execution focus)
- Different API and SDK
- Less enterprise-ready than Temporal
- May need to migrate workflows

**Recommendation:** Evaluate Prefect if cost is primary concern. Temporal provides better durable execution guarantees.

---

### Option 4: Combined Optimizations

**Use GPT-3.5 + Prefect Cloud**

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Microsoft Graph API | $0.00 |
| Jira Cloud API | $0.00 |
| Azure Functions | $0.00 |
| Azure Key Vault | $0.03 |
| **Prefect Cloud** | **$0.00** |
| **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5)** | **$1.00** |
| **TOTAL** | **$1.03/month** |

**Annual Cost: $12.36**

**Savings vs. Standard: $1,368/year (99% reduction!)**

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower AI quality (but still good)
- Different workflow platform
- Less enterprise features
