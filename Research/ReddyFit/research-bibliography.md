## Future Research Needs

### Areas Requiring Deeper Investigation

1. **Battery Optimization Deep Dive**
   - Need: Benchmark tests on real devices (iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S24)
   - Gap: No academic papers on adaptive GPS sampling for fitness apps

2. **Indoor GPS Beacon Deployment**
   - Need: Gym partnership case studies
   - Gap: Cost analysis for BLE beacon network (per sq. ft.)

3. **Local AI Models (On-Device Inference)**
   - Need: Llama 3.2 (1B params) benchmark on mobile devices
   - Gap: Battery impact of on-device LLM inference

4. **Move-to-Earn Legal Compliance**
   - Need: SEC/FTC guidance on in-app reward currencies
   - Gap: Tax implications for users (are ReddyCoins taxable income?)
