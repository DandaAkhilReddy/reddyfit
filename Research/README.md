## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Local-First Architecture

**Principle:** Data stays on device unless user explicitly opts in

| Data Type | Storage | Sync to Cloud? | Encryption |
|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Progress Photos | React Native FS | 🔒 User consent | AES-256-CFB |
| GPS Tracks | SQLite (local) | 🔒 Anonymized zones only | SQLCipher |
| Body Metrics | MMKV (local) | 🔒 User consent | Device keychain |
| Search Queries | MMKV (local) | ❌ Never | Device keychain |
| AI Chat History | SQLite (local) | 🔒 Encrypted backup | SQLCipher |
| Public Posts | Cached locally | ✅ Always (designed for sharing) | In transit only |

**Key Privacy Features:**
- ✅ SearXNG (no query logging, no user tracking)
- ✅ Local encryption (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- ✅ Ephemeral location sharing (GPS auto-deleted after 24h)
- ✅ GDPR/CCPA compliant (data export, deletion, portability)
