## ✅ Website is Ready to Deploy!

All fixes have been completed:
- ✅ Hero section now visible immediately (no more blank page)
- ✅ Framer Motion animations optimized
- ✅ Metadata warning fixed
- ✅ All 7 pages working correctly
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (2 Options)

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Fastest - 2 minutes)

```bash
cd website

# Login to Vercel (opens browser)
npx vercel login

# Deploy to production
npx vercel --prod
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Set up and deploy?** Yes
- **Which scope?** Select your account
- **Link to existing project?** No
- **Project name?** reddyfit-website
- **Directory?** ./ (default)
- **Build settings?** Yes (auto-detected)

Your site will be live at: `https://reddyfit-website-[hash].vercel.app`

### Option 2: GitHub + Vercel Auto-Deploy (Best for CI/CD)

#### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd website
git init
git add .
git commit -m "ReddyFit marketing website with all 4 transitions"
git branch -M main

# Create GitHub repo first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/reddyfit-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 2: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Click "Deploy" (Vercel auto-detects Next.js)

**That's it!** Vercel will:
- Auto-deploy on every git push
- Provide preview URLs for PRs
- Handle SSL certificates
- Set up CDN globally
